# Wikipedia-Outreachy-Application
Outreachy Final Application 2021

Your past experience with this free software community and project:

I found out about the Outreachy internships thanks to a Twitter user - @iamdoomling who is a designer and programmer- who recommended them in August 2021, she had started the internship but she could not complete it due to work reasons at the time. Based on her recommendation, I was interested in knowing more about this community and I started to inform myself exhaustively through all the documentation offered by the Outreachy website, the Applicant Guide, the documentation about open source projects and all the links that I found of different advices and experiences of various interns of this program, reflected in the blogs created by them. After having read everything I didn’t hesitate to apply to Outreachy.

Your past experience with other free software communities:

I think that the open source project best known to me is precisely Wikipedia, since it’s the most famous and largest encyclopedia on the internet -and the world- and I have consulted it since I have a computer with internet (a long time ago). I have always been a great "fan" of encyclopedias, since I was a child, I spent hours reading articles in large printed volumes, then, with the arrival of a PC in my family home, I have done the same with digital encyclopedias that came in CD-ROM format, spending hours and hours rambling through articles of all kinds. And, finally, I did the same approach with Wikipedia, with an immensity never seen before.
I can hardly give testimony of contributions, I only remember having made anonymous contributions to some articles (now I only remember the last one, I added a movie that I had recently seen to the filmography of an actress, since it wasn’t updated yet). With the approaching tasks for this project -Wikimedia: Automatically matching new Wikipedia articles with Wikidata items using Python- I have been able to get to know, first-hand, and more in depth, the work environment about coding in a Wikimedia project, this time working not only from the environment of the Wikipedia and Wikidata interfaces but also accessing through the command console and working with Pywikibot.

Your relevant personal or class projects that relate to this project:

The experience obtained in the Outreachy contribution period is more than welcome to me, and I feel very grateful about it, since it has given me an overview of what it is to work remotely with different co-applicants and a mentor, in the area of IT and open source projects, experience that I haven’t had before and that undoubtedly motivates me to continue training in Python and learn more about open source projects.
Regarding my personal goals, although I have had educational and work experiences not related to the IT world, since 2020 -in the middle of the pandemic- I began to be interested in the world of programming languages. My studies -Universidad de Buenos Aires- were on Art theory (especially cinema), with a solid base in semiotics and communication, so I don’t find the area of formal languages strange, and I have always been curious about science as well, although I have not had a formal education in it.
I have started with the fundamentals of programming and the basics of Javascript and a bit of Ruby. In June of this year I began to study Python, and I find in this internship a great opportunity to consolidate my knowledge and be able to apply it to specific tasks in the field of an open source project in Wikimedia. My goal in this project is to be able to find efficient ways of automation with Python for establishing links between Wikipedia and Wikidata elements, using the tools that Pywikibot offers.
I aim to apply my knowledge and learn more about how Python works, not only in exercises, in the context of coding classes, - so far I have taken two courses on Python, with online and live classes, and a basic online, asynchronous course-, but to learn and apply this knowledge while contributing to a collective project like Wikimedia. My goal is to be able to reach a certain quality in solving specific problems with Python and gain experience in the IT field, in open source projects.

On your final application, you said the time commitments listed on your initial application are not correct. You provided the following updates about your time commitments:

I have already finished courses #1 and #3. I am not currently doing course #2 anymore.

Timeline of tasks for the internship period:

From December 6th to 17th:

Get even more familiar with the Pywikibot package and its modules.
Learn more about how the API works.
From December 20th to 31th:

Study the operation of pre-existing functions and scripts created by others (e.g. the code repository by my mentor Mike Peel) to exhaustively dig into how the code works.
Document different areas and categories of topics to work with, identify relevant information to take into account when starting to code.
From January 3rd to February 11th:

Define a specific coding task plan for data collection, information matching between Wikidata and Wikipedia, and automation process.
Create specific scripts for each task.
From February 14th to March 4th:

Polish and correct the scripts to finally integrate them into the live code to keep in sync Wikidata and the different language Wikipedias.
For each stage, document in a blog what has been learned and developed.
I don't have any other commitments during the internship's period. I have a temporary job right now, it started on September 1st and it ends on November 30th. I work with the online Video Library and with the database of accreditations of the Mar del Plata International Film Festival in Argentina.
